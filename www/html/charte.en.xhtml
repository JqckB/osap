Access to IT resources and Internet services  </p><p class="P8"> </p><p class="P4">Use of the IT resources and Internet services, and the network to access the former, is destined for the professional activity of users in compliance with effective legalisation. Professional activity shall be understood as having the meaning defined in the documents setting forth the CNRS’ assignments.  </p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P4">Use of the entity’s shared IT resources and the connection of private, external equipment (such as a computer, switch, modem, wireless access station…) to the network is subject to the authorisation of the entity’s manager and to the entity’s security rules.
