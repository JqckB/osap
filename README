Typical use scenario
--------------------

 o guest machines connecting to a network, need to be authenticated
 o the router gives them DHCP leases and redirects all web traffic 
   to the portal. The rest is blocked.
 o once authenticated, the IP is added to a different table, to let 
   traffic pass the gateway
 o if the users clicks on the 'Disconnect' button, or its lease expires, 
   go back to initial (blocked) state
 o machines without a valid DHCP lease can't do anything : all trafic
   is blocked
